# HOW TO BUILD pcre

== FYI
* I tried on Mac OS X 10.6.6 and using Android PDK 2.3.3(ginger bread), later I'll try ubuntu 10.10(maverik) and Android 2.2(froyo)

* read this site first, this is really impressive
  http://.... Oops! I forgot the site URL
  
* I got original Android.mk from this thread
    Issue 1344:	PCRE library needs packaging
    http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=1344
    for Android 2.3.3, LOCAL_MODULE_TAGS directive is missing, 
    and I got errors such as:
      build/core/binary.mk:335: target `external/pcre/pcre-8.12/pcre_chartables.o' doesn't match the target pattern
	  arm-eabi-gcc: no input files
      make: *** [external/pcre/pcre-8.12/pcre_chartables.o] Error 1
	so, I update and fix it


== building pcre for Android emulator
* download freash tarball from pcre project site
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcre/files/
  and extract it into ${PDK_ROOT}/external
  At the time writing this, 8.12 is the latest version.
  I tried pcre-8.10, it also works fine.

* run configure script, which generates config.h and so on. like this:
    > export PDK_ROOT=<where you repo init android source tree>
    > export PATH=<path to compiler>:$PATH
			  
	> cd ${PDK_ROOT}/external/pcre-8.12
    > ./configure --host=arm-eabi CC=arm-eabi-gcc CPP=arm-eabi-cpp CFLAGS="-nostdlib" CPPFLAGS="-I${PDK_ROOT}/prebuilt/darwin-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-4.4.3/lib/gcc/arm-eabi/4.4.3/include-fixed -I${PDK_ROOT}/development/ndk/platforms/android-8/include -I${PDK_ROOT}/bionic/libc/include/ -I${PDK_ROOT}/bionic/libc/arch-arm/include/ -I${PDK_ROOT}/bionic/libc/kernel/common/ -I${PDK_ROOT}/bionic/libc/kernel/common/linux/" LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath-link=${PDK_ROOT}/out/target/product/generic/system/lib -L${PDK_ROOT}/out/target/product/generic/system/lib -lc" LIBS="-lc" --enable-utf8 --enable-unicode-properties
  NOTE: Even in the korg/gingerbread-release branch, ndk/build/platforms/android-10 isn't found, so I used android-8, whose target is Android 2.2
  NOTE: if you got an error "configure: error: C preprocessor "arm-eabi-cpp" fails sanity check", see config.log, and you may see some headers not found message, in the case, revise/add include paths
  
* copy Android.mk and build it
    > cp <path to git cloned directory>/Android.mk ${PDK_ROOT}/external/pcre-8.12
    > . ${PDK_ROOT}/build/envsetup.sh
	> mm SHOW_COMMANDS=1
  you'll get the binary in ${PDK_ROOT}/out/target/products/system/lib/libpcre.so and ${PDK_ROOT}/out/target/products/system/bin/pcregrep
