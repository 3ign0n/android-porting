NOTE: THIS DOCUMENT IS UNFINISHED
NOTE: in Android.mk, common source static link mode, that is BUILD_OPTION_COMMON_SRC_STATIC := true, has linking errors.
            if you want to build common sources as statically linked modules, use Eric Chan's Android.mk commited at 462c320edc5f8127ba730ecbe648ebdd1424d30b

== FYI
* lighttpd requires libpcre
* I tried on Mac OS X 10.6.6 and using Android PDK 2.3.3(ginger bread), later I'll try ubuntu 10.10(maverik) and Android 2.2(froyo)
* At writing this document, lighttpd 1.4.28 is the latest version, so I tried it.

== Building lighttpd for Android
* First of all, you should read Eric Chan's great post. Thanks a lot for his great effort.
  http://ericdev.blogspot.com/2009/09/add-lighttpd-to-android-as-web-service.html
  His article is a little old, so, I got some error when I simply followed his instructions.
  And his Android.mk is inefficient and generated binary is big footprint because common source file is compiled and statically linked to each module.
  So I revise and improve that point.

* run configure script and generate config.h, src/configfile.h etc (Eric skipped this step, instead, his method requires his step(3)-(5))

== How to build lighttpd as one binary, all of modules are statically linked
* to get basic knowledge, read Willem's "Lighttpd with static modules" http://codemonkeytips.blogspot.com/2010/02/lighttpd-with-static-modules.html
* use Android.mk.static instead of Android.mk
* edit Androd.mk.static, set BUILD_OPTION_MOD_xxx options true/false to enable/disable them
* generate plugin-static.h manually, and copy it into ${lighttpd-build-top}/src/
   this bug report helps you to know how plugin-static.h looks like. "dir-listing vs. index-file" http://redmine.lighttpd.net/issues/1893
* copy Android.mk.static, and rename it to Android.mk

== deploy lighttpd and modules
* For your products, you should put them into system image. but here, I'm just testing on the emulator,
  so I pushed them into /data/www with adb


== How to access lighttpd on the emulator
* Before launching lighttpd, check your config file syntax. like this:
    > /data/www/bin/lighttpd -f /data/www/etc/lighttpd.conf -t
  then execute it foreground
    > /data/www/bin/lighttpd -f /data/www/etc/lighttpd.conf -m /data/www/lib -D

  NOTE: if you build common sources as dynamically linked library liblighttpd_common.so, 
             and if you don't deploy it into /system/lib, launch lighttpd with LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. like this:
			   > LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/www/lib /data/www/bin/lighttpd -f /data/www/etc/lighttpd.conf -m /data/www/lib -D
			 if you don't specify LD_LIBRARY_PATH, you'll got an error
			   link_image[1995]: failed to link /data/www/bin/lighttpd
			   CANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE

=== MacOS X
* Setting up tun/tap
   install tuntaposx from macports
     > sudo port install tuntaposx
  
* change owner /dev/tapX device, for example, I'm using tap10
    > sudo chown <user name>.<group name> /dev/tap10
  
* booting up emulator
  user-space slirp networking "-net user" is required for adb, when I didn't add the options, the emulator was crashed in my environment
    > emulator -avd AVD2.2 -show-kernel -verbose -qemu -net nic,vlan=0 -net user -net nic,vlan=1 -net tap,vlan=1,fd=tap10
  
  Hey! How can I configure the host network interface?
  No tap device can be seen in the command result.
    > sudo ifconfig -a

  OK, I have a another choice.
    > emulator -avd AVD2.2 -show-kernel -verbose -qemu -redir tcp:8008::80
  here, 8080 is host port, 80 is listen port which you wrote in lighttpd.conf
  then access port 8080 on the host
    > wget -O - http://localhost:8080

  Yay! I got the message from lighttpd!!
