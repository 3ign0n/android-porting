== FYI
* lighttpd requires libpcre
* I tried on Mac OS X 10.6.6 and using Android PDK 2.3.3(ginger bread), later I'll try ubuntu 10.10(maverik) and Android 2.2(froyo)
* At writing this document, lighttpd 1.4.28 is the latest version, so I tried it.

== Building lighttpd for Android
* First of all, you should read Eric Chan's great post. Thanks a lot for his great effort.
  http://ericdev.blogspot.com/2009/09/add-lighttpd-to-android-as-web-service.html
  His article is a little old, so, I got some error when I simply followed his instructions.
  And his Android.mk is inefficient and generated binary is big footprint because common source file is compiled and statically linked to each module.
  So I revise and improve that point.

* run configure script and generate config.h, src/configfile.h etc (Eric skipped this step, instead, his method requires his step(3)-(5))

  NOTE: if you want, add --with-webdav-props and --with-webdav-locks, those options doesn't require any extra libraries

* build lighttpd
    change PDK_ROOT variable in Android.mk fitting to your environment
    > mm

== deploy lighttpd and modules
* For your products, you should put them into system image. but here, I'm just testing on the emulator,
  so I pushed them into /data/www with adb


== How to access lighttpd on the emulator
* Before launching lighttpd, check your config file syntax. like this:
    > /data/www/bin/lighttpd -f /data/www/etc/lighttpd.conf -t
  then execute it foreground
    > /data/www/bin/lighttpd -f /data/www/etc/lighttpd.conf -m /data/www/lib -D

=== MacOS X
* Setting up tun/tap
   install tuntaposx from macports
     > sudo port install tuntaposx
  
* change owner /dev/tapX device, for example, I'm using tap10
    > sudo chown <user name>.<group name> /dev/tap10
  
* booting up emulator
  user-space slirp networking "-net user" is required for adb, when I didn't add the options, the emulator was crashed in my environment
    > emulator -avd AVD2.2 -show-kernel -verbose -qemu -net nic,vlan=0 -net user -net nic,vlan=1 -net tap,vlan=1,fd=tap10
  
  Hey! How can I configure the host network interface?
  No tap device can be seen in the command result.
    > sudo ifconfig -a

  OK, I have a another choice.
    > emulator -avd AVD2.2 -show-kernel -verbose -qemu -redir tcp:8008::80
  here, 8080 is host port, 80 is listen port which you wrote in lighttpd.conf
  then access port 8080 on the host
    > wget -O - http://localhost:8080

  Yay! I got the message from lighttpd!!
